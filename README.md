The Space Base
==============

This project is a 3D platformer made in Unity and my fourth game creation. In this game, the player must navigate a series of deadly obstacles in order to get to the end, with the optional additional challenge of collecting each of the six coloured orbs placed along the player's route. The goal is to make it to the end as fast as possible!

To improve upon my previous games, I implemented passcodes in some areas that must be discovered and entered by the player, as well as a large puzzle to be solved, and I also implemented a gravity reversal feature and scripted a sequence of consecutive enemy attacks. I also experimented with different assets to make better-looking menus and scenes.

I designed and created the arena using assets from the Unity Asset Store, and I also worked with scripting, GUI, animations, textures, audio, lighting, and editing 3D models (sculpting, posing, modifying vertices, and arranging scenes). To play the game, you can download the .zip file for the build using **[this link](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1gSNAK2ZZJHmp5pzwot2zI2-SD2GoAFLK)** and run `The Space Base.exe`. You can also check out **[this page](https://bensta.epizy.com/spacebase/)** to see some images of the game along with a list of assets used in the final build and links to the sources.

Below are some preview images of the game:
